# a99 Final Project - Public Health Survey Web App

## Summary 

In today's day and age, information is gold. Our full-stack web application provides a central place for researchers to mine this informational gold in the public health space. Our platform lets users post public health-related surveys, submit responses to these surveys, and also view any responses to surveys they've made. Users can also update their passwords or delete their accounts, and those who know the admin password are able to view the application's logs. Essentially, this project is a one-stop, easy-to-access shop for public health information gathering.

## Installation and Use

We have provided a couple of scripts to help install and start the web app locally on your device.

1. ```npm run startall``` will install all of the dependencies for the project and start up the database and server. 
2. ```npm run install-all``` will install all of the dependencies for the project.
3. ``` npm start ``` will start up the database and server (will not work if dependencies aren't installed).

Essentially, if you clone this repository and run ```npm run startall``` from the project's root directory, the app should be opened. Of course, make sure you have Node and npm installed on your device before you do this. Hope you enjoy!

## Project Planning

We used GroupMe to communicate in real-time with team members. In order to scope and plan our project, we utilized the projects feature within github. Here we were created "to-do," "in progress," and "done" cards. We also met many times over zoom, and recorded notes of those meetings in the projects tab.
