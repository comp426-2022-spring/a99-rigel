# Public Health Survey Web Application

## Summary 

In today's day and age, information is gold. Our full-stack web application provides a central place for researchers to mine this informational gold in public health space. Our platform lets users post public health-related surveys, submit responses to these surveys, and also view any responses to surveys they've made. Essentially, it is a one-stop, easy-to-access shop for public health information gathering.

## Demo

## Try it Out!
To run our app on your own computer, first make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, clone this repository, and simply run the following script in your terminal, which will install all needed dependencies and start the app:
```
npm run startall
```
This app should now be running on your device! It will take a while to load initially, so please be patient. Once it is done, your browser should automatically open the app at http://localhost:3000/!

If that does not work, try manually going to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. Also, make sure that you were in the root directory of this project when you ran "npm run startall," or else the script will not work!

## Other Scripts
Besides "npm run startall," our project has two other noteworthy scripts.

Since there are three package.json files in our project, we have a script for installing all dependencies in all three package.json files. Note that you do not have to run this if you've already run "npm run startall":
```
npm run install-all
```
After all dependencies have been installed (if you've run "npm run install-all" or "npm run startall" at least once), you can start the app by simply running:
```
npm start
```

## Team Roles

## Project Planning

We used GroupMe to communicate in real-time with team members. In order to scope and plan our project, we utilized the projects feature within github. Here we were created "to-do," "in progress," and "done" cards. We also met many times over zoom, and recorded notes of those meetings in the projects tab.
