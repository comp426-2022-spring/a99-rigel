# a99 Final Project

# Public Health Survey Dashboard

## Summary 

We created a platform that allows researchers to post public health related surveys, let users submit their responses to these surveys, and then let the researchers see their response. In todays day in age, information is gold. This dashboard provides a central place for researchers to conduct relevant research in the public health space. The researcher can create new surveys, see existing research surveys, and see the results to their own survey. Essentially, it is a one-stop shop for public health surveys.

## Demo

## Try it Out!
To run our app on your own computer, first make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, clone this repository, and simply run the following script in your terminal:
```
npm run startall
```
This app should now be running on your device! It may take a while to load initially, so please be patient. Once it is done, your browser should automatically open the app! 

If that does not happen, try going to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. Also, make sure that you were in the root directory of this project when you ran "npm run startall", or else the script will not work!

## Project Planning

We used groupme to communicate in real time between team members. In order to scope and plan our project we utilized the projects feature within github. Here we were able to create to-dos, in progress, done cards. We also met over zoom and have meeting notes in the projects tab.
