# a99 Final Project - Public Health Survey Web App

## Summary 

In today's day and age, information is gold. Our full-stack web application provides a central place for researchers to mine this informational gold in the public health space. Our platform lets users post public health-related surveys, submit responses to these surveys, and also view any responses to surveys they've made. Essentially, it is a one-stop, easy-to-access shop for public health information gathering.

## Demo

## Try it Out Locally!
To run our app on your own device, first make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, clone this repository, and run the following script in your terminal, which will install all needed dependencies and start the app:
```
npm run startall
```
The app should now be running on your device! It will take a while to load initially, so please be patient. Once it is done, your browser should automatically open the app at http://localhost:3000/!

Make sure that you were in the root directory of this project when you ran "npm run startall," or else the script will not work!

If you want to install all necessary dependencies without also starting the app, run:
```
npm run install-all
```
After all dependencies have been installed (if you've run "npm run install-all" or "npm run startall" at least once), you can start the app locally by simply running:
```
npm start
```

## Project Planning

We used GroupMe to communicate in real-time with team members. In order to scope and plan our project, we utilized the projects feature within github. Here we were created "to-do," "in progress," and "done" cards. We also met many times over zoom, and recorded notes of those meetings in the projects tab.
